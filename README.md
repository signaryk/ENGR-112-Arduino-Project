# ENGR-112-Arduino-Project

A repository containing code used for robots in Spring 2018 ENGR 112's Arduino semester project.

---

This project was completed using Pololu's "Zumo" line of robots, including the 32U4 and Shield models.

**Goalie**: Uses Zumo32U4 robot to drive forwards and backwards in order to act as a goalkeeper at the end of an obstacle course. Also plays "The Final Countdown"

**remoteInterpret**: Uses the Zumo Shield, Arduino Uno, and XBee radio modules to navigate obstacle courses by receiving commands remotely via the radio module.
